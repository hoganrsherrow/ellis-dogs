                <h2>Louie</h2>
                <p>
                    Louie is an AKC registered standard poodle and has a fantastic temperament.  His expressions and overall laid back attitude makes him super special to us.  At the end of a long day he loves to just lay his head in your lap and close his eyes.  He is what you would call a velcro dog which means he wants to be with you all the time and with his personality is not a bad thing.

                <p>
                    Josie is registered with the ASDR and is a first time mom.   She has been an absolute joy to have by our side.  She has a great temperament and loves to be around our other pets.  She loves to go exploring in the fields, playing with the other dogs, and is an all around loving companion.
