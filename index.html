            <h2>About the breed</h2>

            <p>Ellis Acres Aussiedoodles is a small farm owned and operated by Troy and Angela Ellis in Middle Tennessee.   We are a small breeder that focus on raising healthy, and polite pups.  With a  background in training we will work with the future owners to ensure that they are a valued member of your family.  We are not a puppy mill.  Our entire breeding program are with our 2 dogs Louie and Josie. This allows us to be very deliberate with the litter and hands on with the pups.  By the time they leave they will have been socialized with other dogs, people, and most importantly will have learned how to romp through the fields and have fun.
            </p>

            <h2>Are Aussiedoodles Right for you?</h2>
            <p>We breed standard size aussiedoodles which should be in the 50 to 65 lb range.  It makes for a good size dog that thrives as much indoors with you as they do adventuring when the time comes.  With the Poodle and Aussie sides they will make incredibly smart members of your family but with fair warning, they need to have mental and physical stimulation so they don’t get bored to keep your furniture intact.  They also should be hypoallergenic which should cut down on shedding and allow you to spend more time with your dog than cleaning up after them.  With all of the doodles out there it might get confusing on which one is better.  We chose the Aussiedoodle for the sum of the parents and we couldn’t be more pleased.  Aussies are traditionally farm dogs, highly intelligent, and want to please their owners.  They have high energy when needed and can lay next to the couch with you for hours when it’s raining outside and be just as content.  The Poodle has the curly coat, loves the water, loves to fetch and has more expressions of any dog that we have ever owned.  If you try to teach them anything you can see them trying to figure out what you are asking and it definately makes training more fun than a chore.
